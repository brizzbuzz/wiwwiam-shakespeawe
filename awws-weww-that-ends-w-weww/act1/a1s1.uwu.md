than w-wack it whewe t-thewe is such a-abundance. σωσ

### wafeu
modewate w-wamentation is the wight of the d-dead, >w<

excessive g-gwief the enemy to the wiving. òωó

the ambition in my w-wuv thus pwagues i-itsewf:

### h-hewena
a-ay. (ꈍᴗꈍ) you have s-some stain of sowdiew i-in you: wet m-me

ask you a question. man is e-enemy to viwginity; h-how

may we bawwicado it against h-him?

t-thewe's wittwe c-can be said i-in 't; 'tis against t-the

wuwe of nyatuwe. ʘwʘ to speak on the pawt of v-viwginity, rawr x3

is to accuse youw mothews; which is most infawwibwe

disobedience. (⑅˘꒳˘) h-he that hangs himsewf is a viwgin:

viwginity muwdews i-itsewf and s-shouwd be buwied in

highways out of aww sanctified wimit, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) as a despewate

offendwess a-against n-nyatuwe. òωó viwginity b-bweeds mites, ʘwʘ

m-much wike a cheese; consumes itsewf t-to the vewy

p-pawing, (ꈍᴗꈍ) and so d-dies with feeding his own stomach. òωó

b-besides, viwginity is peevish, (U ﹏ U) pwoud, idwe, (˘ω˘) made of

sewf-wuv, (˘ω˘) w-which is the most inhibited s-sin in the
